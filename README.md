This is my simple 2D Physics Simulator, built in C++ and uses SFML for graphics rendering. 
This simulator can simulate basic 2D physics like collision detection and response for circles. 
Currently, I'm focused on refining its performance by developing an optimized collision detection algorithm. 
The optimization aims to create a more accurate simulation and handle simulating more objects. 
The project is also expanding to simulate more complex objects, like quadrilaterals, and polygons.
