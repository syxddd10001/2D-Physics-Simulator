This is my simple 2D Physics Simulator, built in C++ and uses SFML for graphics rendering. 
It can simulate 2D physics like kinematics, collision detection, and response for circles and quadrilaterals accurately,
using an optimized Quadtree Algorithm, which has an O(n log n) time complexity for collision detection. It can also simulate gravity and uses the Barnes Hut algorithm
for force calculation and approximation, which also has an O(n log n) time complexity. 
Currently, I'm focused on optimizing its performance using multithreading, adding spring physics, and also 
add more complex objects like polygons and n-gons.
