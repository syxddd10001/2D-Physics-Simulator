This is my simple 2D Physics Simulator, built in C++ and uses SFML for graphics rendering. 
It can simulate 2D physics like kinematics, collision detection, and response for circles and quadrilaterals accurately,
using an optimized Quadtree Algorithm, which has an O(n log n) time complexity, for collision detection. 
Currently, I'm focused on adding gravity and spring physics, optimizing its performance more using multithreading, and also 
add more complex objects like polygons and n-gons.
