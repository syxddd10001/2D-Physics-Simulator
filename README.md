This is my simple 2D Physics Simulator, built in C++. 
This simulator can simulate basic 2D physics like collision detection and response for objects like circles and rectangles. 
Currently, I'm focused on refining its performance by developing an optimized collision detection algorithm. 
The optimization aims to create a more accurate simulation and handle simulating more objects. 
The project is also expanding to simulate more complex objects, like trapezoids and polygons.
